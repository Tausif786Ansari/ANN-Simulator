# ANN-Simulator
An interactive Neural Network Playground built with Streamlit and PyTorch that allows users to design custom ANN architectures, train models in real time, and visualize decision boundaries to intuitively understand deep learning behavior.

# Interactive Neural Network Playground

An interactive Artificial Neural Network (ANN) training and visualization tool built with **Streamlit** and **PyTorch** that enables users to design custom neural network architectures and observe learning behavior in real time.

This project aims to make deep learning more **visual**, **intuitive**, and **experiment-driven** by combining architecture customization with live decision boundary visualization.
